      <p id="aboutMe">Hi i'm Cheyann, a dedicated student currently, in the world of design/programming at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School, set to graduate in 2025, and motivated by the awareness of the growing significance of coding in today's society, I've chosen this path to not only explore the realms of design but also to learn more about coding. Committed to staying at the forefront of technological advancements, as well as learning skills that can be beneficial to me when looking for work. Beyond my academic pursuits, I find inspiration in films like "A Silent Voice" and "A Whisker Away." I really enjoy the spontaneous feeling of the movies, which I can relate to my spontaneous passion for becoming an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) in the future.

               <p id="career">
                 I'm uncertain about my professional path, but I have a clear goal: I aspire to become an EMT. However, I'm also intrigued by the possibilities in design and programming. My ambition includes working for major companies like Google or Microsoft. If I secure an internship there and they decide to hire me, I'll embark on a career in design, development, and coding. In case the internships don't help me secure some sort of job, my plan is to attend college or a trade school to pursue my EMT certification. While my ultimate aim is to become a paramedic, I would be content as an EMT. Additionally, I envision having a side job, and coding seems ideal. Whether it becomes a full-time job or a source of extra income, coding holds great appeal for me. My future professional path is based on the success of my internship and the opportunities it may bring. I'm convinced that the skills acquired in this class will benefit any career I pursue. Recognizing coding as a highly sought-after skill by employers, I believe it will enhance my desirability in the workforce. I'm grateful for the opportunities this class provides, opening doors to higher-paying and less stressful jobs. If my path leads me to be an EMT or paramedic, I am confident that coding can offer a well-paying backup plan. In addition to that, from a young age, I felt a calling to pursue a career in healthcare. My aspirations evolved from dreaming of becoming a vet to considering nursing, and now I've found my passion as an EMT. The nature of the job resonates with me, offering a constant stream of interesting challenges. The prospect of never feeling bored in a profession that demands quick thinking and adaptability is something I truly value.
