      <p id="aboutMe">So, a bit about me: my name is Cheyann, and I'm a senior at Thomas Edison. I’ve got two cats, Max and Phoenix, that keep me entertained and slightly stressed since they are always running around. Lately, I’ve been trying to get more into music, still figuring out my vibe, but it’s been fun! I like to think I’m a hard worker, and I’m pretty good at keeping up with deadlines, so things don’t pile up on me. Also, I’m a huge fan of bunnies; they're just so cute and fluffy! In my free time, I enjoy thrifting to find unique pieces and experimenting with makeup. It’s a nice way to unwind. <u>All of my social networking can be found on my contact me page :3. </u> </p>

               <p id="career">Choosing to pursue a career as a radiology technician has been a clear path for me, rooted in my desire to work in the medical field and contribute to a hospital environment. After exploring various careers, I found that radiology perfectly aligns with my interests and skills. I appreciate the balance of working both independently and as part of a team, allowing me to collaborate with others while also engaging in focused tasks. My experience in design and development, particularly in creating apps and projects aimed at alleviating users' pain, has deepened my empathy and awareness of the challenges people face. This understanding, coupled with the skills I’ve gained from meeting deadlines and working collaboratively, will serve me well in my future career. I intend to attend college to become a licensed technician, specializing in MRI and CT scans. I’m genuinely excited about the opportunity to learn about these technologies and the impact they have on patient care.</p>
