                 I'm uncertain about my professional path, but I have a clear goal: I aspire to become an EMT. However, I'm also intrigued by the possibilities in design and programming. My ambition includes working for major companies like Google or Microsoft. If I secure an internship there and they decide to hire me, I'll embark on a career in design, development, and coding. In case the internships don't help me secure some sort of job, my plan is to attend college or a trade school to pursue my EMT certification. While my ultimate aim is to become a paramedic, I would be content as an EMT. Additionally, I envision having a side job, and coding seems ideal. Whether it becomes a full-time job or a source of extra income, coding holds great appeal for me. My future professional path is based on the success of my internship and the opportunities it may bring. I'm convinced that the skills acquired in this class will benefit any career I pursue. Recognizing coding as a highly sought-after skill by employers, I believe it will enhance my desirability in the workforce. I'm grateful for the opportunities this class provides, opening doors to higher-paying and less stressful jobs. If my path leads me to be an EMT or paramedic, I am confident that coding can offer a well-paying backup plan. In addition to that, from a young age, I felt a calling to pursue a career in healthcare. My aspirations evolved from dreaming of becoming a vet to considering nursing, and now I've found my passion as an EMT. The nature of the job resonates with me, offering a constant stream of interesting challenges. The prospect of never feeling bored in a profession that demands quick thinking and adaptability is something I truly value.
