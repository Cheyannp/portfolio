       <p class="aboutMe">Hiii, welcome to my profile for <b>senior year!</b> This year has been so rewarding, and I’m grateful for all the amazing friends I’ve made along the way. From fun times spent together to all the support we’ve shared, this year wouldn’t have been the same without them. Looking ahead, I’m super excited about what’s next—there’s so much to look forward to, and I feel ready for it.</p>
<p class="aboutMe">Working on my projects has been one of the best parts of the year, too. Every project brought something new and creative, and I’ve learned so much in the process. I hope you enjoy exploring them as much as I enjoyed making them!</p>
 <p class="aboutMe">To check out these <u>projects</u>, <u>view my resume</u>, or visit my <u>contact page</u>, just head up to the top menu. If you’re curious to learn more <u>about me</u>, click on the pixel art to the right. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
