    <h4 class="Description"> In this project, we focused on understanding and applying relative and absolute links, with relative links directing users to locations within the same website and absolute links connecting to external sites. This activity helped us revisit HTML fundamentals, strengthening essential skills that will be crucial in future projects. <h4>

      <p class="Description">For this activity, we were provided with CSS and a sample image of a webpage. Our task was to match the HTML to the CSS to replicate the design accurately. This exercise was especially valuable because it pushed us to think critically about how each HTML element aligns with specific CSS properties to achieve the intended look. </p>

    <p class="Description">Summary - In this project the code utilized the input function to prompt the user for the side lengths, converting the input to integers for numerical operations. Next three different areas were calculated: the area of the rectangle (sideA * sideB), the area of the smaller right triangle ((sideA - sideC) * (sideD - sideE - sideB)), and the area of the larger right triangle (0.5 * (sideA - sideC) * sideE). These areas were then summed up to determine the overall room area. Something I struggled with was the math portion of it. I found it difficult to understand how to calculate the sides of the shape.</p>
