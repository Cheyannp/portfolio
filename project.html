    <h4 class="Description"> In this project, the goal was to create a shape/design using lines and coordinates in Trinket. One challenge was figuring out the coordinates for placing the lines accurately. However, during the process I discovered a helpful feature in Trinket that shows the coordinates when hovering over the mouse. This proved to be a valuable tool for understanding and implementing the correct coordinates. Despite the initial challenge of figuring out the coordinates, the coding itself is clear and concise. I learned about the strokeWeight and stroke functions, which are used to control the line thickness and color. Overall, this project helped me explore creating things on different platforms than the ones I am used to. <h4>

   <h3 class="projectHeadings">Draw A House</h3>

    <br>
    <h4 class="Description">In this project, the task was to create a house using shapes and colors. The learning focus was on how to manipulate different shapes, layer them, and apply colors to bring a visual concept to life through code. One challenge I encountered was working with coordinates, as it often involved rounding and guessing, making the process time-consuming, especially when adjusting everything. The code for the project creates various shapes to form a house, tree, snowman, and a background. I used different polygons, circles, and lines to achieve the desired image. One key takeaway from the project was gaining experience in creating complex designs through the strategic use of shapes and colors. Despite the initial struggle with coordinates, this project enhanced my understanding of combining creativity with coding, emphasizing the importance of patience when working with shapes and coordinates to achieve visually appealing results.<h4>

   <h3 class="projectHeadings">Animation</h3>

    <a target="_blank" href="https://py3.codeskulptor.org/#user309_R6GS57KkkL_0.py"><img class="image" src="Animation.png" width="200" height="300"></a>
    <br>
    <h4 class="Description">In this project, I created an animation using SimpleGUI that alternates between a sun and a moon, simulating a day-night cycle. The animation includes various elements such as a stick figure, a balloon, clouds, buildings, and changing backgrounds to represent different times of the day. The sun is drawn with multiple shapes representing its features, including a smile, eyes, blush, and a playful appearance. It moves horizontally from left to right, creating the illusion of sunrise. The moon, on the other hand, has craters, eyes, and a mouth. It also moves horizontally from right to left, suggesting the transition to nighttime. The background color changes during the animation to signify different phases of the day. This project provided valuable experience in creating an animation, as it was my first time doing something like this. I initially had a hard time understanding the logic behind making it move. However, once I was able to troubleshoot and try out different things, I found a way to get the shapes to move in the way I wanted them to, creating the animation.<h4>

    <h4 class="Description"> In this project, we focused on understanding and applying relative and absolute links, with relative links directing users to locations within the same website and absolute links connecting to external sites. This activity helped us revisit HTML fundamentals, strengthening essential skills that will be crucial in future projects. I faced some challenges getting used to HTML again since I hadnâ€™t done a project in a while, but I overcame this by using W3Schools for guidance.

        <br>
      
      <p class="Description">For this activity, we were provided with CSS and a sample image of a webpage. Our task was to match the HTML to the CSS to replicate the design accurately. This exercise was especially valuable because it pushed us to think critically about how each HTML element aligns with specific CSS properties to achieve the intended look. I struggled a bit with making sure all the HTML matched up with the CSS, but I overcame this by really focusing on what I was doing.</p>

    <br>
       
    <p class="Description">In this app challenge, my partner and I chose to focus on an issue that is deeply important to us: women's wellness. We developed an app called Purely, designed specifically to address this critical topic. Our goal was to create a supportive community where girls and women can feel safe, heard, and empowered to share their experiences. Through Purely, users can access resources, connect with one another, and engage in meaningful discussions about wellness. We faced challenges in ensuring that we created something we were proud of and that would genuinely be helpful, but we worked through this by continually discussing our ideas and refining our approach.</p>
