    <h4 class="Description"> In this project, we focused on understanding and applying relative and absolute links, with relative links directing users to locations within the same website and absolute links connecting to external sites.

      <p class="Description">For this activity, we were provided with CSS and a sample image of a webpage. Our task was to match the HTML to the CSS to replicate the design accurately. This exercise was especially valuable because it pushed us to think critically about how each HTML element aligns with specific CSS properties to achieve the intended look. </p>
