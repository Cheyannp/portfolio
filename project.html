    <h4 class="Description"> In this project, we focused on understanding and applying relative and absolute links, with relative links directing users to locations within the same website and absolute links connecting to external sites. This activity helped us revisit HTML fundamentals, strengthening essential skills that will be crucial in future projects. I faced some challenges getting used to HTML again since I hadnâ€™t done a project in a while, but I overcame this by using W3Schools for guidance.

      <p class="Description">For this activity, we were provided with CSS and a sample image of a webpage. Our task was to match the HTML to the CSS to replicate the design accurately. This exercise was especially valuable because it pushed us to think critically about how each HTML element aligns with specific CSS properties to achieve the intended look. I struggled a bit with making sure all the HTML matched up with the CSS, but I overcame this by really focusing on what I was doing.</p>

    <p class="Description">In this app challenge, my partner and I chose to focus on an issue that is deeply important to us: women's wellness. We developed an app called Purely, designed specifically to address this critical topic. Our goal was to create a supportive community where girls and women can feel safe, heard, and empowered to share their experiences. Through Purely, users can access resources, connect with one another, and engage in meaningful discussions about wellness. We faced challenges in ensuring that we created something we were proud of and that would genuinely be helpful, but we worked through this by continually discussing our ideas and refining our approach.</p>
